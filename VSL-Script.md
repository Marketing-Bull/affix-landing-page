**Video Length:** 3-4 minutes
**Tone:** Professional, trustworthy, conversational

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)
**[Visual: Attractive home exterior, family enjoying their space]**

**NARRATOR:**
"If you're a homeowner sitting on substantial equity, what I'm about to share could give you access to hundreds of thousands of dollars... without taking on a traditional loan, without monthly payments, and without refinancing your existing mortgage."

**[Text on screen: NO MONTHLY PAYMENTS • NO REFINANCING • NO LOAN]**

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:50)
**[Visual: Graph showing rising interest rates, stressed homeowner looking at bills]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Maybe you've thought about tapping into your home equity before. But the traditional options? They all have serious drawbacks.

A cash-out refinance? You lose your low interest rate and get stuck with a higher one.

A HELOC? Monthly payments that add to your debt burden.

A home equity loan? More debt. More payments. More stress.

And all of them require you to qualify with your credit score and income."

**[Text on screen: TRADITIONAL OPTIONS = MORE DEBT + MONTHLY PAYMENTS]**

## THE SOLUTION (0:50 - 1:30)
**[Visual: Clean, modern office, professional advisor with homeowner, friendly handshake]**

**NARRATOR:**
"But there's a better way. It's called a Home Equity Agreement, or HEA - an alternative to traditional home equity loans and HELOCs.

Here's how it works: You receive a lump sum of cash - up to $500,000 - based on your home's current value. Your settlement amount is tied to your home's value at the time you settle the agreement.

The best part? There are ZERO monthly payments. That's right - no payment due every month eating into your budget.

You keep living in your home. You keep making decisions about your property. And you don't add any monthly debt to your finances."

- UP TO $500,000 CASH
- ZERO MONTHLY PAYMENTS
- AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL LOANS
- KEEP YOUR CURRENT MORTGAGE RATE]**

## HOW IT'S DIFFERENT (1:30 - 2:00)
**[Visual: Side-by-side comparison chart, checkmarks and X marks]**

**NARRATOR:**
"A Home Equity Agreement is an alternative to traditional home equity loans. There's nothing to pay back monthly. Instead, you settle the agreement when you sell your home, refinance, or after the 10-year agreement term.

Your settlement amount is based on your home's value at the time you settle - see the HEA terms for full details.

And here's what really sets it apart: we work with homeowners who have credit scores as low as 500. Bad credit? Not a deal breaker."

Help your children or grandchildren with a down payment.

Cover medical expenses without stress.

Or simply have financial peace of mind knowing you have substantial liquid assets available.
